# MalariaDetection-ML
This repository contains a machine-learning project aimed at detecting malaria from images of White Blood cells.

## Description
This repository contains a machine-learning project aimed at detecting malaria from white blood cell images. The project encompasses the following key components:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Steps for cleaning and augmenting the dataset.
- **Model Training:** Implementation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other machine learning algorithms like the XGBoost model and Passive Aggressive Classifier Model for malaria detection.
- **Evaluation:** Metrics and methods to assess model performance.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation and notebooks to understand and reproduce the results.
